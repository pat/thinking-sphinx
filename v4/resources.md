## External Resources

I am happy to provide support via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pat/thinking-sphinx/issues), [the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/thinking-sphinx/), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/thinking-sphinx) where possible.

### Books

There was once a PDF publication on Thinking Sphinx, published by Peepcode. Sadly, it's no longer for sale (but it's terribly out of date now anyway).

### Blog Posts

Keep in mind some of these posts may refer to features/code relevant to older versions of Thinking Sphinx.
