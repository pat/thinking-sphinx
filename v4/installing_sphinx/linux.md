## Installing Sphinx on Linux

Most Linux package managers have Sphinx available as a pre-built package, though sometimes their versions may be a bit old. For Debian and Ubuntu, the package name is `sphinxsearch`. Gentoo's portage has it available as just `sphinx`.

There are also prebuilt binaries for Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS and Debian [available](http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/release/) on the Sphinx site.

If you don't want to use your package manager, then you can [compile Sphinx yourself](/thinking-sphinx/installing_sphinx.html#compiling).
