* [FIX] Excerpts are now wildcard-friendly.
* [FIX] Facet searches now use max_matches value (with a default of 1000) to ensure as many results as possible are returned.
* [CHANGE] Exceptions raised when communicating with Sphinx are now mentioned in the logs when queries are retried (instead of STDOUT).

* [FEATURE] Collection of hooks (lambdas) that get called before indexing. Useful for delta libraries.
* [FIX] Cast and concatenate multi-column attributes correctly.

* [FIX] Default search panes are cloned for each search.

* [FIX] All string values returned from Sphinx are now properly converted to UTF8.
* [CHANGE] GroupEnumeratorsMask is now a default mask, as masks need to be in place before search results are populated/the middleware is called (and previously it was being added within a middleware call).

2013-03-23: 3.0.2
* [CHANGE] per_page now accepts an optional paging limit, to match WillPaginate's behaviour. If none is supplied, it just returns the page size.

* [FIX] Primary keys that are not 'id' now work correctly.
* [CHANGE] Setting a custom framework will rebuild the core configuration around its provided settings (path and environment).
* [CHANGE] Search masks don't rely on respond_to?, and so Object/Kernel methods are passed through to the underlying array instead.
* [FIX] Search options specified in index definitions and thinking_sphinx.yml are now used in search requests (eg: max_matches, field_weights).
* [FEATURE] Indexes defined in app/indices in engines are now loaded (Antonio Tapiador del Dujo).
* [FIX] Custom association conditions are no longer presumed to be an array.
* [CHANGE] Empty search conditions are now ignored, instead of being appended with no value (Nicholas Klick).

* [FEATURE] Query errors are classified as such, instead of getting the base SphinxError.

2013-02-04: 3.0.1

* [FEATURE] Mysql2::Errors are wrapped as ThinkingSphinx::SphinxErrors, with subclasses of SyntaxError and ParseError used appropriately. Syntax and parse errors do not prompt a retry on a new connection.

* [CHANGE] UTF-8 is now the default charset again (as it was in earlier Thinking Sphinx versions).
* [FEATURE] Initial realtime index support, including the ts:generate task for building index datasets. Sphinx 2.0.6 is required.
* [CHANGE] Removing ts:version rake task.
* [FEATURE] SphinxQL connection pooling via the Innertube gem.

2012-12-22: 3.0.0.rc

* [FEATURE] Wordcount attributes and fields now supported.
* [FEATURE] Support for Sinatra and other non-Rails frameworks.
* [FEATURE] A sphinx scope can be defined as the default.
* [FEATURE] An index can have multiple sources, by using define_source within the index definition.
* [FEATURE] sanitize_sql is available within an index definition.
* [FEATURE] Providing :prefixes => true or :infixes => true as an option when declaring a field means just the noted fields have infixes/prefixes applied.
* [FEATURE] ThinkingSphinx::Search#query_time returns the time Sphinx took to make the query.
* [FEATURE] Namespaced model support.
* [FEATURE] Default settings for index definition arguments can be set in config/thinking_sphinx.yml.

* [FIX] Suppressing delta output in test helpers now works (Darcy Laycock).
* [FEATURE] A custom Riddle/Sphinx controller can be supplied. Useful for Flying Sphinx to have an API layer over Sphinx commands, without needing custom gems for different Thinking Sphinx/Flying Sphinx combinations.

2012-10-06: 3.0.0.pre
* First pre-release. Not quite feature complete, but the important stuff is certainly covered. See the README for more the finer details.
