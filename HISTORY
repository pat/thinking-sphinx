* [FIX] Default search panes are cloned for each search.
* [FIX] Index-level settings (via set_property) are now applied consistently after global settings (in thinking_sphinx.yml).
* [FIX] All string values returned from Sphinx are now properly converted to UTF8.

* [FEATURE] Indexes defined in app/indices in engines are now loaded (Antonio Tapiador del Dujo).
* [FIX] Custom association conditions are no longer presumed to be an array.
* [CHANGE] Empty search conditions are now ignored, instead of being appended with no value (Nicholas Klick).
* [CHANGE] Custom conditions are no longer added to the sql_query_range value, as they may involve associations.
