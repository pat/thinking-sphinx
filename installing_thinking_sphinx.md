## Installing Thinking Sphinx

Installing Thinking Sphinx is a little different depending on which version of Rails/ActiveRecord you're using - though generally you should be aiming to use a version 3.x release (if you're running on Rails 3.1 or newer):

* [Rails 3.1 or newer](installing_thinking_sphinx/ts3.html)
* [Rails 3.0](installing_thinking_sphinx/ts2.html)
* [Rails 2.3](installing_thinking_sphinx/ts1.html)
* [Sinatra and Other Frameworks](installing_thinking_sphinx/sinatra.html)

Thinking Sphinx no longer officially supports Rails/ActiveRecord 2.2 or older, but you can use v1.4.11 in these situations. Most of the documentation here (for v1/v2 releases) will be accurate.
