## Thinking Sphinx

### What?

A concise and easy-to-use Ruby library that connects ActiveRecord to the [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com) search daemon, managing configuration and searching.

### Why?

Sphinx is a very fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways of searching it. Thinking Sphinx allows you to link up your models into Sphinx simply and painlessly -– because let’s face it, searching across multiple fields using SQL is a pain in the neck.

### Where?

Read up on [installing Sphinx](installing_sphinx.html) and [then Thinking Sphinx](installing_thinking_sphinx.html).

### Who?

[Pat Allan](http://freelancing-gods.com) is the developer behind Thinking Sphinx, and the underlying API for Sphinx, [Riddle](https://freelancing-gods.com/riddle/). [Many, many others](https://github.com/pat/thinking-sphinx/contributors) have contributed valued patches and ideas.

### Most importantly: How?

Read [the quickstart guide](quickstart.html), along with the rest of the documentation.

And when you get stuck, there's always [the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/thinking-sphinx/).
