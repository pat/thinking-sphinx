h1. Thinking Sphinx

Please note: this is the branch for Rails 3. At some point in the near future, it will be released as Thinking Sphinx 2.0. It does not work with versions of Rails before v3 - I'm not sure if that'll happen in the future, but was just too much hassle right now.

If you want to give this a spin, clone the repo, check out the rails3 branch, and run @rake build@ to generate the gem.

h2. Usage

First, if you haven't done so already, check out the main "usage":http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/usage.html page. Once you've done that, the next place to look for information is the specific method docs - ThinkingSphinx::Search and ThinkingSphinx::Index::Builder in particular.

Keep in mind that while Thinking Sphinx works for ActiveRecord with Merb, it doesn't yet support DataMapper (although that is planned).

h2. Contributing

Fork on GitHub and after you've committed tested patches, send a pull request.

To quickly see if your system is ready to run the thinking sphinx specs, run the contribute.rb script found in the project root directory. Use the following instructions to install any missing requirements.

To get the spec suite running, you will need to install the ginger gem:

<pre><code>sudo gem install ginger --source http://gemcutter.org</code></pre>
  
Then install the cucumber, yard, jeweler and rspec gems. Make sure you have a git install version 1.6.0.0 or higher, otherwise the jeweler gem won't install. Bluecloth is required for some of the yard documentation.

<pre>
  sudo gem install bluecloth cucumber yard jeweler rspec 
</pre>

Then set up your database:

<pre>
  cp spec/fixtures/database.yml.default spec/fixtures/database.yml &&
  mysqladmin -u root create thinking_sphinx
</pre>
  
This last step can be done automatically by the contribute.rb script if all dependencies are met.

Make sure you don't have another Sphinx daemon (searchd) running. If you do, quit it with "rake ts:stop"
in the app root.

You should now have a passing test suite from which to build your patch on.

<pre>
  rake spec
</pre>

If you get the message "Failed to start searchd daemon", run the spec with sudo:

<pre>
  sudo rake spec
</pre>

If you quit the spec suite before it's completed, you may be left with data in the test
database, causing the next run to have failures. Let that run complete and then try again.
