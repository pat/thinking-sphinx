h1. Thinking Sphinx

Welcome to Thinking Sphinx version 3 - a complete rewrite from past versions. Right now it is a work-in-progress, missing many of the features in TS 2 and earlier. It's also currently built for Rails 3 only.

Still interested? Well, read on!

h2. Installation

There's no gem (prerelease or otherwise) at this point - so you'll need to use the git reference:

<pre><code>gem 'thinking-sphinx',
  :git    => 'git://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx.git',
  :branch => 'edge',
  :ref    => 'current-commit-ref'</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Indexes are no longer defined in models - they now live in `app/indices` (which you will need to create yourself). Each index should get its own file, and look something like this:

<pre><code># app/indices/article_index.rb
ThinkingSphinx::Index.define :article, :with => :active_record do
  indexes title, content
  indexes user.name, :as => :user
  indexes user.articles.title, :as => :related_titles

  has published
end</code></pre>

You'll notice the first argument is the model name downcased and as a symbol, and we are specifying the processor - @:active_record@. Everything inside the block is just like previous versions of Thinking Sphinx. Same goes for @config/thinking_sphinx.yml@ (formerly @config/sphinx.yml@).

Other changes:
* SphinxQL is now used instead of the old socket connections (hence the dependency on the @mysql2@ gem).
* You'll need to include @ThinkingSphinx::Scopes@ into your models if you want to use Sphinx scopes.
* The match mode is always extended - SphinxQL doesn't know any other way.
* ActiveRecord::Base.set_sphinx_primary_key is now an option in the index definition (alongside @:with@ in the above example): @:primary_key@ - and therefore is no longer inheritable between models.
* If you're explicitly setting a time attribute's type, instead of @:datetime@ it should now be @:timestamp@.
* Delta arguments are passed in as an option of the @define@ call, not within the block:

<pre><code>ThinkingSphinx::Index.define :article, :with => :active_record, :delta => true do
  # ...
end</code></pre>

* Suspended deltas are no longer called from the model, but like so instead:

<pre><code>ThinkingSphinx::Deltas.suspend :article do
  article.update_attributes(:title => 'pancakes')
end</code></pre>

* Excerpts through search results behaves the same way. Excerpt options (like @:before_match@, @:after_match@ and @:chunk_separator@) can be passed through when searching under the @:excerpts@ option:

<pre><code>ThinkingSphinx.search 'foo',
  :excerpts => {:chunk_separator => ' -- '}</code></pre>

If you want to excerpt any string without going through an object, you can use the search result set's excerpter object:

<pre><code>results = ThinkingSphinx.search 'foo'
results.excerpter.excerpt!('The Etymology of Foo')</code></pre>

* When indexing models on classes that are using single-table inheritance (STI), make sure you have a database index on the @type@ column. Thinking Sphinx will need to determine which subclasses are available, and we can't rely on Rails having loaded all models at any given point, so it queries the database. If you don't want this to happen, set :skip_sti to true in your search call, and ensure that the :classes option holds all classes that could be returned.

<pre><code>ThinkingSphinx.search 'pancakes',
  :skip_sti => true,
  :classes => [User, AdminUser, SupportUser]</code></pre>

* The option @:rank_mode@ has now become @:ranker@ - and the options (as strings or symbols) are as follows: proximity_bm25, bm25, none, wordcount, proximity, matchany, and fieldmask.
* There are no explicit sorting modes - all sorting must be on attributes followed by ASC or DESC. For example: @:order => '@weight DESC, created_at ASC'@.
* If you specify just an attribute name as a symbol for the @:order@ option, it will be given the ascending direction by default. So, @:order => :created_at@ is equivalent to @:order => 'created_at ASC'@.
* If you want to use a calculated expression for sorting, you must specify the expression as a new attribute, then use that attribute in your @:order@ option. This is done using the @:select@ option to specify extra columns available in the underlying SphinxQL (_not_ ActiveRecord/SQL) query.

<pre><code>ThinkingSphinx.search(
  :select => '@weight * 10 + document_boost as custom_weight',
  :order  => :custom_weight
)</code></pre>

* Support for latitude and longitude attributes named something other than 'lat' and 'lng' or 'latitude' and 'longitude' has been removed. May add it back in if requested, but would be surprised if it's a necessary feature.
* Set INDEX_ONLY to true in your shell for the index task to re-index without regenerating the configuration file.
* If you want to pass the old-style @:include@, @:joins@, @:select@ or @:order@ parameters through to the underlying ActiveRecord SQL queries for instantiating search results, they should go in a hash within the search option @:sql@:

<pre><code>Article.search :sql => {:include => :user}</code></pre>

* SphinxQL only supports grouping by single attributes - but these attributes may be generated on the fly within the select statement (see the @:select@ option above). A grouped search uses the @:group_by@ option, and you can pass in the attribute name as either a symbol or a string:

<pre><code>Article.search :group_by => :user_id</code></pre>

* If you want to change the order of which result appears for each group, that can be done via the @:order_group_by@ option - which behaves just like @:order@ does:

<pre><code>Article.search(
  :group_by       => :user_id,
  :order_group_by => 'created_at DESC'
)</code></pre>

* The @each_with_group@, @each_with_count@ and @each_with_group_and_count@ enumerators are available when using the @:group_by@ option (but are otherwise not available to search objects). Please note the spelling - older versions of Thinking Sphinx allowed for groupby and group, this is no longer the case.
* @each_with_weight@ (again, note that it's weight, not weighting) is available, but not by default. Here's an example of how to have it part of the search object:

<pre><code>search = Article.search('pancakes')
search.masks << ThinkingSphinx::Masks::WeightEnumeratorMask

search.each_with_weight do |article, weight|
  # ...
end</code></pre>

* Batched/Bulk searches are done pretty similarly as in the past - here's a code sample that'll only hit Sphinx once:

<pre><code>batch = ThinkingSphinx::Search::Batch.new
batch.searches << Article.search('foo')
batch.searches << Article.search(:conditions => {:name => 'bar'})
batch.searches << Article.search_for_ids('baz')

# When you call batch#populate, the searches are all populated with a single
# Sphinx call.
batch.populate

batch.searches #=> [[foo results], [bar results], [baz results]]</code></pre>

* To search on specific indices, use the @:indices@ option, which expects an array of index names (including the @_core@ or @_delta@ suffixes).
* @:without_any@ has become @:without_all@ - and is implemented, but Sphinx doesn't yet support the required logic.
* If you're creating a multi-value attribute manually (using a SQL snippet), then in the definition pass in @:multi => true@, but @:type@ should be set as well, to one of the MVA types that Sphinx supports (@:integer@, @:timestamp@, or @:boolean@).
* Automatic updates of non-string attributes are still limited to those from columns on the model in question, and is disabled by default. To enable it, just set attribute_updates to true in your @config/sphinx.yml@.

h2. Limitations

Basic indexing and searching should be fine. There's currently no facets or excerpts, and limited delta support. Many settings haven't yet been brought across. Many of the smaller features don't yet exist either. Some may actually not return... we'll see.

Lists of what still needs to be implemented, in no particular order but in groups of vague importance:

Required for Pre-Release:

* Facets
* Separate out glazier panes/decorators.

Required for Release Candidate:

* Query and Ranged Query sources for Attributes and Fields
* Using :though association shortcuts in index definitions
* Overwritable toggle_delta? method on model
* Query times for searches
* Namespaced models support
* Delayed Deltas
* Datetime Deltas
* Infixing and Prefixing of specific fields
* Default Sphinx scopes
* sanitise_sql method in index definitions
* Multiple sources for an index
* Bitmask weighting helper
* JRuby support
* Sinatra support
* Wordcount fields and attributes

May or may not be added:

* Timezone support (for databases not using UTC)
* Abstract Inheritance support (maybe - not sure this is something many of people want).
* Capistrano Tasks

h3. Sphinx Versions

TS 3 is built for Sphinx 2.x only. You cannot use 1.10-beta, 0.9.9 or anything earlier than that.

h3. Rails Versions

Currently TS 3 is built to support Rails/ActiveRecord 3.1 or newer. Sinatra is not yet supported, but it will be.

TS 3 does not support Rails 3.0, Rails 2.x or earlier, or Merb - please refer to the TS 1.x and 2.x releases in those situations.

h3. Ruby Versions

Built on MRI 1.9.3 and tested against MRI 1.9.2 as well. No plans to support MRI 1.8, but would like to support Rubinius and JRuby (the one catch with the latter is the different MySQL interfaces).

h3. Database Versions

MySQL 5.x and Postgres 8.4 or better are supported.

h2. Contributing

You're brave! To contribute, clone this repository and have a good look through the specs - you'll notice the distinction between acceptance tests that actually use Sphinx and go through the full stack, and unit tests (everything else) which use liberal test doubles to ensure they're only testing the behaviour of the class in question. I've found this leads to far better code design.

If you're still interested in helping evolve this, then write the tests and then the code to get them passing, and send through a pull request. No promises on merging anything, but we shall see!

For some ideas behind my current approach, have a look through @sketchpad.rb@ in the root of this project. If you can make sense of that, you're doing very well indeed.
