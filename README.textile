h1. Thinking Sphinx

h2. Usage

First, if you haven't done so already, check out the main "usage":http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/usage.html page. Once you've done that, the next place to look for information is the specific method docs - ThinkingSphinx::Search and ThinkingSphinx::Index::Builder in particular.

h2. Contributing

Fork on GitHub and after you've committed tested patches, send a pull request.

To get the spec suite running, you will need to install the not-a-mock gem if you don't already have it:

  git clone git://github.com/freelancing-god/not-a-mock.git
  cd not-a-mock
  rake gem
  gem install pkg/not_a_mock-1.1.0.gem

Then set up your database

  cp spec/fixtures/database.yml.default spec/fixtures/database.yml
  mysqladmin -u root create thinking_sphinx

You should now have a passing test suite from which to build your patch on.

  rake spec
