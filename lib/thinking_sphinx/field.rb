module ThinkingSphinx
  # Fields - holding the string data which Sphinx indexes for your searches.
  # This class isn't really useful to you unless you're hacking around with the
  # internals of Thinking Sphinx - but hey, don't let that stop you.
  #
  # One key thing to remember - if you're using the field manually to
  # generate SQL statements, you'll need to set the base model, and all the
  # associations. Which can get messy. Use Index.link!, it really helps.
  # 
  class Field
    attr_accessor :alias, :columns, :sortable, :associations, :model
    
    # To create a new field, you'll need to pass in either a single Column
    # or an array of them, and some (optional) options. The columns are
    # references to the data that will make up the field.
    #
    # Valid options are:
    # - :as       => :alias_name 
    # - :sortable => true
    #
    # Alias is only required in three circumstances: when there's
    # another attribute or field with the same name, when the column name is
    # 'id', or when there's more than one column.
    # 
    # Sortable defaults to false - but is quite useful when set to true, as
    # it creates an attribute with the same string value (which Sphinx converts
    # to an integer value), which can be sorted by. Thinking Sphinx is smart
    # enough to realise that when you specify fields in sort statements, you
    # mean their respective attributes.
    #
    # Here's some examples:
    #
    #   Field.new(
    #     Column.new(:name)
    #   )
    #
    #   Field.new(
    #     [Column.new(:first_name), Column.new(:last_name)],
    #     :as => :name, :sortable => true
    #   )
    # 
    #   Field.new(
    #     [Column.new(:posts, :subject), Column.new(:posts, :content)],
    #     :as => :posts
    #   )
    #
